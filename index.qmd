+------------------------------------+----------------+
| Club Position in event             | Ranking points |
|                                    |                |

| 5th                                | 1              |
+------------------------------------+----------------+
| All others                         | 0              |
+------------------------------------+----------------+

If the rank totals are tied, then the total scores of the top four archers at each event are used to break the tie. In the unlikely event that these scores too are tied, then the matter cannot be settled by bows, and it is pistols at dawn.
